## 👩🏻‍🎓About Me
During the first semester at Columbia University, I studied different languages in Machine Learning and applied them to the ‘Quantilope’ project (data extraction, visualization, and analysis). 
Besides, before entering Columbia, I worked at Ernst&Young, one of the Big Four Accounting Firms as an Assurance intern. I participated in the preliminary and annual audits of a top 10 real estate company with a senior review. Also, I interned at IMP digital as a project manager assistant to improve and develop WeChat mini-programs of luxury companies, using Python to build up and manage the background data for financial analysis. 
Therefore, I am looking for an opportunity in financial analysis using data tools in different fields.
